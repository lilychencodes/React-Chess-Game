## Note from author
This little repo is my pet project. You may ask me, "why chess? Isn't it a little overdone?"
Well, you are not wrong. But here's the cool thing about chess. It could be as simple and complex as you want it to be.

**It's a fun project for programmers of any skill level.**

It was one of the very first projects I had to do when I was studying programming at App Academy. Back then, all I had to do was make something display in the terminal with basic rules built in.
Now, my plan to make this into a polished, performant, user-friendly product with many nice-to-have features.
This little project will continue to evolve as my skills as an engineer evolve with time.

Without further ado, here are the functionalities of the current product and what's coming up in the roadmap:

## Features
[] Basic rules are built in so players cannot make illegal moves.
[] Legal moves are highlighted when a piece is selected.
[] If the king is in check, player must move the king out of check
[] If the king is in check and there are no valid moves, the king is checkmated and the game is over.

## Roadmap
[] Castling
[] En passant
[] Ability to go back to any prior moves and replay the game from then
[] Ability to take back the last move made
[] Ability to "fork" a new branch of the game from any prior move
[] Drag and drop pieces
[] Convert to TypeScript
[] Add unit tests
[] Add ability to play against computer
